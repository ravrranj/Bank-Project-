# Bank-Project-
We are using the 4 pillars of OOPS concept in Java 


✅ Encapsulation → Private balance & account details
✅ Inheritance → SavingsAccount and CurrentAccount extend BankAccount
✅ Polymorphism → Different withdraw() implementations
✅ Abstraction → BankAccount as an abstract class


// 
implemented : 
Encapsulation → Secure account details (balance, account number).

Inheritance → Different types of bank accounts (Savings, Current).

Polymorphism → Different deposit/withdrawal methods.

Abstraction → Abstract class for common bank operations.
